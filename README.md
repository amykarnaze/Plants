### Abstract

Edible plants is a mod 3 solo project that tasked us to build an app of our own imagination. I created an edible plants app to allow users to see all the plants that one can harvest and eat in the world!

Check out Plants Deployed: ![deployed page](https://plants-deploy.herokuapp.com/)

### SetUp

To view this application,
1) Clone down the repository.
2) Cd into the project.
3) Run `npm install`.
4) Run `npm test` to see tests pass.
5) `npm start` runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

A user can search for plants by name:<br />

### Wins
* React Jest testing asynchronous methods
* Components and file structure are well organized.
* Succesfully created a React app on my own.
* Utilized react router and its render properties.

### Challenges
* Learning jest mocking syntax
* Async and await timing issues

### Next plan

In the future, I would like to add a backend with more medicial plant details that will allow users to search by location and display medicinal properties. In addition, include more photos of each plant for identification.
